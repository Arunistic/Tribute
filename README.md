<br>
Hello There!!!ðŸ‘‹\
This is my first ever project...\
It is hosted on vercel !!!!\
\
Please access the website here:<a target="_blank" href="https://arashotribute.vercel.app/"> Click Here!! </a>\
\
~~Google has flagged it as unsafe... but don't worry.. to view it click on details and 'then this unsafe site'.. I assure you it is completely safe..&#128516;~~\
\
  **Good News!!!**\
  The website has now become a *safe site*!!!!<br>
  Use google safe browsing-google transparency report to check about your website..<br>
  If it is flagged... login to google search console and after you've declared your ownership ask for a review stating you have fixed some bug...<br>
  Soon you'll recieve a mail from google console regarding the review stating that the site has now become safe..

The website uses basic **HTML, CSS and JS**.<br>
If you go through the source code ( which you shouldn't &#x1F609;!!) you'll understand the usage of flex and become familiar with DOM and event-listening.
<br> Please let me know your insights on it..
